## Introduction
The Personal Trainer App creates an easy way to create routines for beginner, intermediate and advanced runners. We use ChatGPT's API to prompt text into the AI and automatically create a routine based on the answers that the users select from a questionnaire. The application can be scalable with the implementation of more sports and activities in the future development.
